# FilterIt
FilterIt is a tool that helps you parse and filter query strings easily. You can use it on both the front-end and back-end sides of your app.

## Front-end Usage
On the front-end side of your app, you can use FilterIt to build dynamic query strings that can be used to filter data on the server-side. Here's a simple example of usage:
```javascript
    const filter = new FilterIt();
    filter.Equal('id', 20).OrEqual('id', 22).SortBy('age');

    console.log(filter.toString()); // id=equal:20||equal:22&sort=age:desc
```

In this example, we're creating a new FilterIt object and adding some filter and sort criteria to it. The toString() method returns a formatted query string that can be used on the back-end side of your app.

## Back-end Usage
On the back-end side of your app, you can use FilterIt to parse the query string generated by the front-end and use it to filter data in your database. Here's an example of how to use FilterIt with Laravel:
```php
class UserController extends BaseController
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        return User::filterit($request->query())->get();
    }
}

```
